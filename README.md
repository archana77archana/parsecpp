# parsecpp

Using a `.c` file, we parse a `.cpp` file and extract the student detail information from it which are the object initializations in the `.cpp` file to create a `.html` file and a student details table in it. You can sort the table by clicking on the headings in the table according to the column header you are clicking on. You can also filter the table by department.

## Compiling

`gcc parsecpp.c -o parsed`

## Executing

`./parsed student_details.cpp`
